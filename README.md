# berlin_weather
This is my first data analysis. It is for the weather in Berlin, GER between 1876 and 2019. Data proceed from the German Weather Office as well as from Prussian Archives fro the period 1876 until 1945. The very early data has only basic measurements. This data set accompany my learning process from very beginning.
